## Dashboard
Overview of riders, popular routes and times to ride.

### Insights
- From the Dashboard, we can see that most users are members, but there are still a good portion of riders who are not. So, there is opportunity to try and convert those riders to members.
- It seems like users are using more classic bike, but that is not to say that e-bike use is low, it is still quite close in terms of use.
- The most popular routes are
  - Norfolk St & Broome St to Henery St & Grand St
  - Roosevelt Island Tramway (return bike to station)
  - Vernon Blvd & 50 Ave to Franklin St & Dupont St
  - Grand Army Plaza & Central Park S (return bike to station)
  - Henry St & Grand St to Norfolk St & Broome St

### Insights
From the Story, we can see that rides are more popular during the afternoon commuting hours, between 2 and 6 PM. When comparing the most popular stations between start and end stations, only 1 station appears on both lists, W 21 St & 6 Ave. This station is also the most popular overall, as it is at the top of both of these lists. From the map, this look like it in the Flatiron District, which is a very busy area, so it makes sense that there would be high demand in from this station as a start and ending point for people.
